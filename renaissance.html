<h2 id="History"> History </h2>
<p> The Renaissance period flourished in Florence, Italy in the 14th century. It is a French word that means  "rebirth". It is inevitable to talk about the Renaissance without the Medieval period,
   a dark time where Europe had a dramatic change socially, politically and economically.
  During the Medieval times,the economic class was basically the clergy and the peasants which were the poorest people. During the medieval era, nobody was allowed to study math or classical
   humanism for their paintings which led to unrealistic work of the human body, such as paintings of people with eighteen ribs,
   or Jesus painted as a boy with a manâ€™s face. Right after the Medieval period ended in Europe, the Renaissane started to appear.
    It came with a new class, the middle class.
   The renaissance brought new ideas of painting which portrayed naturality. A Renaissance man was Michelangelo,
  one of his masterpiece renaissance works is David,
    a marble sculpture that shows the technique of classical humanism. The second of the great Renaissancess
     artists was Urbinoborn Raphael, one of his marvelous paintings was The Alba Madonna, which shows harmony, freshness, and talent.
  Raphael organized the composition according to simple geometric shapes : the triangle, the circle, and the
   trapezoid. The freedom of learning from the Greeks let artists such as Raphael and Michelangelo
    offer a different perspective on art.</p>
