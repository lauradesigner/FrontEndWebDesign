<h2 id="History"> History </h2>
<p class="mainparagraph"> The Renaissance movement took place in Italy and Northern Europe, however, the Early Renaissance predominantly 
  occurred in Florence and then Rome during the later years. It was spearheaded by wealthy families, especially the Medici family. They were also avid patrons of the arts and 
  commissioned various artists, including Botticelli, to produce artworks for them.The Renaissance period flourished in Florence, Italy in the 14th century. It is a French word that means 
   "rebirth". It is inevitable to talk about the Renaissance without the Medieval period,
   a dark time where Europe had a dramatic change socially, politically and economically.
  During the Medieval times,the economic class was basically the clergy and the peasants which were the poorest people. During the medieval era, nobody was allowed to study math or classical
   humanism for their paintings which led to unrealistic work of the human body, such as paintings of people with eighteen ribs,
   or Jesus as a child painted as an adult. Right after the Medieval period ended in Europe, the Renaissane started to appear.
    It came with a new class, the middle class.
   The renaissance brought new ideas of painting which portrayed naturality. A Renaissance man was Michelangelo,
  one of his masterpiece renaissance works is David,
    a marble sculpture that shows the technique of classical humanism. The second of the great Renaissancess
     artists was Urbinoborn Raphael, one of his marvelous paintings was The Alba Madonna, which shows harmony, freshness, and talent.
  Raphael organized the composition according to simple geometric shapes : the triangle, the circle, and the
   trapezoid. The freedom of learning from the Greeks let artists such as Raphael and Michelangelo
    offer a different perspective on art.</p>

   <p class="description"> <strong> The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci/ 1495 to 1498</strong> <br>It is a mural painting by the Italian 
    Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, who was active as a painter, sculptor, engineer, draughtsman, theorist, architect, and scientist.
    The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with his Twelve Apostles. Its handling of space, mastery of perspective,
    treatment of motion, and complex display of human emotion have made it one of the Western world's most recognizable paintings and among 
    Leonardo's most celebrated works. </p>
  <img class="center" src="SistineChapelCeiling.jpg" alt="God creating Adam" width="700" height="350">
   <p class="description"> <strong> The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo/ 1508 to 1512</strong> <br> It is one of the 343 figures painted over 500 square
     meters by the Italian artist Michelangelo on the Sistine Chapel's ceiling inside the Vatican Museums. 
    It is the most famous section of the Sistine Chapel ceiling because this piece changed the perception of God during that time. 
    God has always been regarded as a distinct creature from mankind, but Michelangelo painted him as a simple old man
    shown to be touchable, reachable, and close to mankind.
